# How to Contribute
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All code changes happen through pull requests
We actively welcome your pull requests. Use them to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes
should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Sign your commits with GPG if possible.

## Coding conventions
Please use a consistent coding style. To keep things simple we use the same conventions that are [default for CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/code-style-c-c.html).

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hermes-jr/alpharad/issues/new/choose).
