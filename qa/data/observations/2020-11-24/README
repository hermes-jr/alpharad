2026295 points

All of these are artificially generated, they don't represent actual data. Used for method testing and comparison as edge cases

synth_ideal.log - truncated normal distribution, no hot pixels, no other anomalies

synth_bad_dot.log - as if a single pixel would be generated millions of times more often than others

synth_bad_line.log - one vertical line of pixels is way more active than the other lines

Can be recreated with the following script for perfect case and trivial modifications to introduce artifacts:

```
import scipy.stats as stats

npoints = 2026295
lower, upper_x, upper_y = 0, 640, 480
mu_x, mu_y, sigma = 360, 220, 440

for _ in range(npoints):
    x = stats.truncnorm.rvs((lower - mu_x) / sigma, (upper_x - mu_x) / sigma, loc=mu_x, scale=sigma)
    y = stats.truncnorm.rvs((lower - mu_y) / sigma, (upper_y - mu_y) / sigma, loc=mu_y, scale=sigma)
    print('{}:{}'.format(int(x), int(y)))
```
